# Responsive Portfolio Website

The objective of this project is to build a responsive website using basically just HTML and CSS that showcase a professional portfolio, which include the projects I built throughout the Full-Stack Web Development Program from CareerFoundry, to my professional network and potential employers.

The goal of this project is to create a working website, complete with subpages, that features key information about me as a web developer, relevant work examples, as well as my contact details.


### Features

- A **homepage** with a short introduction and link to work examples;
-  An **about page** with key information about me as an individual, my relevant skills, programming languages I use and a code animation with transitions created only with CSS;
-  A separate **work page** with my work examples created using CSS Grid Layout;
- A separate **contact section** that contains my contact information and a form to leave a message with validation created with JavaScript.
