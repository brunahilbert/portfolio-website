                <p>
                    My Movie Box is a web application built on the MERN stack, offering users a database with
                    information
                    about movies, movie genres and directors. It allows users to personalize their experience by
                    creating accounts, managing personal information, and having a personalized list of favorite movies.

                <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                <p>
                    My Movie Box was a project that I built during my web development course at CareerFoundry to
                    showcase my expertise in full-stack JavaScript development.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-details__item">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The project's goal was to develop a complete full-stack application that would enhance my
                    professional portfolio. My challenge here was to build both the server-side and client-side
                    components of the application from scratch.
                </p>

            <div class="case-study-about-server-side__text">
                <h2>// About the server-side</h2>
                <p>I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, which enables interaction with a MongoDB
                    (non-relational) database. The API utilizes standard HTTP methods like GET and POST to handle data
                    fetching and storage through CRUD operations. Movie information is delivered in JSON format,
                    ensuring compatibility and integration.
                </p>
                <a href="https://my-movie-box.herokuapp.com/documentation">See API Endpoints</a>
                <p>
                    To ensure the API's functionality, I conducted tests using Postman. Additionally, I implemented
                    secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms, including basic HTTP authentication and JWT
                    authentication, to protect data and control access appropriately.

                    alt="Screenshot of Postman">
                <img class="case-study-about-server-side__image" src="img/postman-authorized.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of Postman">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-about-client-side">
            <div class="case-study-about-client-side__text">
                <h2>// About the client-side</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the API was finalized, my focus shifted to constructing the user interface required for the
                    interaction between the user and the server-side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed a responsive, single-page application utilizing React and Redux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application provides a diverse range of views to enhance the user experience. In the main view,
                    users can explore a full list of movies and utilize a search engine to filter movies by title,
                    genre, or director. The single movie view offers detailed information about a specific movie,
                    accompanied by related movie suggestions. Users can easily add or remove movies from their favorites
                    list in both views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the application includes user-friendly login and registration views for account
                    management, and a profile view where users can update their personal information and handle their
                    favorite movie list.

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>
                    This was one of the most challenging projects I had during my web development course at
                    CareerFoundry.
                <p>
                    Building the client side of the MyMovieBox app proved to be the most time-consuming aspect, mainly
                    due to the numerous troubleshooting issues I encountered. In particular, implementing the feature to
                    toggle a movie as a favorite and ensuring that this data remained up-to-date across all views, even
                    after page reload, was particularly challenging and caused me some headaches!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, after extensive research and discussions with more experienced developers, I was able to
                    overcome this challenge.
